Using LaTeX paragraphs and sections


Summary
1. LaTeX uses the commands \section, \subsection and 
\subsubsection to define sections in your document.

2. The sections will have successive numbers and appear in the 
table of contents.

3. Paragraphs are not numbered and thus don't appear in the table of contents.
